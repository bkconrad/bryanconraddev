I'm available for consultation calls about general DevOps and software
development topics. In these calls I'm happy to provide general guidance for
DevOps professionals or organizations with DevOps needs. I can help you make or
contextualize technical decisions, give feedback on technical solutions, or help
you decide on a path for large upcoming initiatives.

Unfortunately I'm not able to solve or perform specific technical tasks in these
consultations. That work can be done as part of a contract engagement so
shoot me an email if you'd like to discuss one.

If for any reason you're unhappy with the result of a call, just send me an
email for a refund. No questions asked.
